Profiles of position-dependent amino acid frequency can be created for motifs, capturing this tug of war between random mutation and natural selection. For the sake of simplicity, we will only be considering exact matches between query motifs and a given sequence here. \n",

Sequence indexes used in biology typically start at +1, whereas Python uses a starting index of 0. \n",
